### Hello everyone, I'm Alfon! ðŸ‘‹


I'm currently a CS student @CUHK-SZ. I am a full-stack programmer. My projects focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and web application. I'm working mostly with python. I'm familiar with web development frameworks i.e. Flask, Django, and node.js. I also enjoy working with front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
